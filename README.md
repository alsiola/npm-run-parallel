Run npm tasks in parallel and exit when they are all done.

## Local development

- `npm run watch` - Compile source code, and watch for changes

### Other commands

- `npm run build` - Compiles source code (also used in `prepublish`)

- `npm run start --` - Emulates the cli interface (_note: pass it task arguments. Useful for manual testing._)
